# Ping-Pong-Game
A basic Ping Pong game using HTML, CSS and JS

### How this works 
1. Every round will start when the 'Enter' key is pressed. ( You can use another key as well )
2. The rods will move horizontally using the 'a' and 'd' keys. ( You can use other keys as well )
3. The losing rod will get the ball for the next match and the rods and ball will move to center.
4. The score will be counted from the start of every match.
5. When the game starts, an alert will be shown about the highest score and the player who scored it.
   - If there is no such record, it will show - 'this is your first time'.
6. After every round, when one wins an alert will be displayed showing the winning player and his score.
